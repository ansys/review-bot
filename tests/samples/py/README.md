# Python Sample Files for PR Testing

These files have been generated in order to test if the review-bot can generate

These sample files were generated from the following prompt

> Generate a sample python function that contains a few simple issues that
> won't be picked up by a compiler. These should not be syntax issues, but
> logic issues. Function should be completely standalone.
